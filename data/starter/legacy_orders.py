"""
legacy_orders.py  -  Loafly's "it ran fine on my laptop" script.

This is the BEFORE. It works for the happy rows, but look at the problems:
  - the price cleaning is copy-pasted inline
  - the discount is a magic number typed into the logic
  - the API key is sitting right here in the code
  - it uses print(), has no error handling, and no retry
  - everything lives in one file

It also crashes the first time it meets an order with a missing price,
which is exactly the kind of 2am breakage this session is about.

Run:  python legacy_orders.py
